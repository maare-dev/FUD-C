-----===== commands =====-----

using version 0.0.1 gamma you can use 13 commands:

increment: + c/cc cell
 * adding 1 to memory cell

decrement: - c/cc cell
 * adding -1 to memory cell

equal: = c/cc cell b/c/cc byte
 * memory cell = next given data

print char: out b/c/cc byte
 * printing char with given number in ASCII

check input: in b/c/cc code b/c/cc place
 * if key with code is pressed jump to place with given number

place: * b/c/cc byte
 * shows interpreter that place with this number is here
 * it can be written after jump command

jump: jump b/c/cc place
 * jumping to place with given number

delay: delay b/c/cc byte
 * makes program wait for given seconds

save memory: save
 * saving all cells of memory to file with second given path

quit: quit b/c/cc code
 * quit with given code

draw frame: draw
 * drawing frame

load memory: load
 * loading memory from file with second given path


-----===== memory =====-----

 * 255 - point_x (using for setting current pixel)
 * 254 - point_y
 *
 * 253 - color_r (color of current pixel) (changing on 255 or 254 change) (you can set this)
 * 252 - color_g
 * 251 - color_b
 *
 * 250 - mouse_x (shows mouse position in window) (always updating)
 * 249 - mouse_y
 *
 * 248 - mouse_1button_status (left) (always updating)
 * 247 - mouse_2button_status (middle)
 * 246 - mouse_3button_status (right)


-----===== comments =====-----

b/c/cc is type of data you give:
 * b means just clear byte to use
 * c means memory cell, from interpreter need to take byte
 * cc means memory cell, data of her shows on memory cell, what gives data



-----===== example of starting compiling file =====-----
java -jar FUD.jar compile (param) code_path exe_path (cursor)
 * (param) may be "-n" (normal mode) or "-d" (debug mode)
 *  (cursor) may be "is" (visible) or "not"

-----===== example of starting running file =====-----
java -jar FUD.jar run (param) exe_path file_to_save_path (cursor)
 * (param) may be "-n" (normal mode) or "-d" (debug mode)
 * (cursor) may be "is" (visible) or "not"
